# Hosting

Hosting this Next.js dashboard requires a Node.js environment. The simplest approach is to build the dashboard for production and run it on a server that supports Node.js. For detailed deployment instructions, refer to the official Next.js documentation:  
[Deploy your Next.js application](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying)

Below are some additional considerations and steps to help you successfully deploy your Next.js application.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Node.js Installed**  
  Make sure your hosting environment has a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (LTS recommended).
- **Production Build**  
  You will need to generate a production build using `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
- **Hosting Provider**  
  Choose a provider that supports Node.js. Common options include:
  - **Vercel** (the platform created by the Next.js team)
  - **Netlify** (via Next.js Runtime)
  - **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** (e.g., Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, or AWS Amplify)
  - **Heroku**
  - **DigitalOcean** (Apps, Droplets)
  - **Docker** containers on any server

---

## 2. Building Your Application

Before deploying, you must create a production build of your Next.js application:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This command compiles your application and prepares it for production. Depending on your project, you may have environment variables to consider during the build process. Make sure they are correctly set or provided.

---

## 3. Running in Production

After building, start the server in production mode:

```bash
npm run start
```

By default, the dashboard will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (unless you’ve changed the port in your configuration).

### Using Process Managers (e.g., PM2)

For stability and uptime, consider using a process manager like [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) or [Forever](https://github.com/foreversd/forever). These tools keep your application running, automatically restart it when it crashes, and can manage multiple Node.js processes.

**Example using PM2**:

```bash
pm2 start npm --name "klimadashboard" -- run start
pm2 logs klimadashboard
```

---

## 4. Environment Variables and Configuration

- **.env Files**  
  Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, connection strings) in `.env` files. Next.js supports `.env.local`, `.env.production` and other environment-specific files.
- **Server-Side Rendering**  
  Ensure that any server-side secrets or tokens are not exposed to the client by properly placing them in server-only environment variables.

---

## 5. Caching and Performance Considerations

- **Static vs. Dynamic Pages**  
  If you have mostly static pages, you can leverage Next.js features like [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration) to improve performance.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**  
  If your dashboard renders data on the server for each request, ensure your server can handle the expected load.
- **Caching Solutions**  
  For heavy traffic scenarios, integrate caching at different layers:
  - Reverse proxy (e.g., NGINX, Apache)
  - CDN (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront)
  - Application-level caching (Redis, in-memory caches)

---

## 6. SSL/TLS and Domain Setup

- **Custom Domains**  
  Most hosting providers allow you to add a custom domain. Follow their documentation to point your domain’s DNS to your hosting environment.
- **HTTPS**  
  Use HTTPS to ensure secure connections. Platforms like Vercel, Netlify, and many others provide free SSL certificates. If you’re self-hosting, consider using [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to automatically manage certificates.

---

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

- **Monitoring Tools**  
  Use tools like [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/), [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/), or other APM services to monitor performance and track errors.
- **Logging**  
  Route application logs to a centralized location using tools like [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston), [Logflare](https://logflare.app/), or built-in solutions from your hosting provider.

---

## 8. Updating Your Dashboard

Once hosted, the application can be updated by pulling any new changes, rebuilding, and restarting. For instance:

```bash
git pull origin main
npm install
npm run build
pm2 restart klimadashboard
```

Automated CI/CD pipelines can simplify this process by automatically deploying updates whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

---

## Summary

- **Build for Production**: Run `npm run build` to create your production build.
- **Run the Server**: Execute `npm run start` (optionally using a process manager like PM2).
- **Choose a Suitable Hosting Provider**: Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Docker, etc.
- **Manage Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files or your hosting provider’s environment variable settings.
- **Optimize Performance**: Use caching and consider Next.js features like ISR for best results.

With these steps in mind, you’re ready to host your Next.js-based dashboard. If you have specific requirements or constraints, adjust your approach accordingly.
